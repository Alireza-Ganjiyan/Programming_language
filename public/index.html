         <h2>Programming languages</h2>
         <p><mark>Programming languages</mark> are tools that developers use to communicate with computers. They are sets of instructions written in a specific syntax that tell a computer what to do — like performing calculations, storing data, displaying content, or interacting with users.
Just like humans speak different languages (English, Persian, etc.), computers understand different programming languages. Each language has its own rules and is designed for specific tasks

         <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p><mark>CSS</mark> stands for <mark>Cascading Style Sheets</mark>. It is the language used to style and design the appearance of web pages. While <mark>HTML</mark> creates the structure of a page, <mark>CSS</mark> controls how it looks — including colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and animations.</p>

         <h2>Java Script</h2>
          <p><mark>JavaScript</mark> is a powerful <mark>programming language</mark> used to make websites interactive and dynamic. While <mark>HTML</mark> builds the structure and <mark>CSS</mark> styles the page, <mark>JavaScript</mark> adds behavior — like responding to clicks, showing alerts, validating forms, and updating content without reloading the page.
JavaScript runs directly in the browser and is supported by all modern web browsers. It can also be used on servers with platforms like <mark>Node.js</mark>.</p>

          <h2>HTML</h2>>
         <p><mark>HTML</mark> stands for <mark>HyperText</mark> Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages. HTML tells the browser how to display content like text, images, links, and videos. It uses <mark>tags</mark> to structure the content, and each tag has a specific purpose</p>

         <h3>PHP</h3>
          <p><mark>PHP</mark> stands for <mark>Hypertext Preprocessor</mark>. It is a <mark>server-side scripting language</mark> used to build dynamic websites and web applications. Unlike HTML and CSS, which run in the browser, PHP runs on the server and generates HTML that is sent to the browser.
